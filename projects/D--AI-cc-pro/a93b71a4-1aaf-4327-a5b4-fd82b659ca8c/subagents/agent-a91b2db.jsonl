The repository appears to be working on power market analysis and prediction features.\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to explore and design an implementation plan for? Please share:\n1. The specific feature or problem you want to address\n2. Any particular perspective or approach you'd like me to take (e.g., performance-focused, maintainability-focused, user experience-focused, etc.)\n3.
