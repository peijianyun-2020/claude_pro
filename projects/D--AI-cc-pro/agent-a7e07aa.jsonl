I cannot and will not:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Install packages or dependencies\n- Make commits or stage changes\n\nI'm here to explore, analyze, and plan - then you or another agent can handle the actual implementation.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design today?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":164,"output_tokens":255,"cache_read_input_tokens":640,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0}}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"8f0d9945-4e99-47df-b773-32400620b65e","timestamp":"2026-01-07T13:20:30.353Z"}
